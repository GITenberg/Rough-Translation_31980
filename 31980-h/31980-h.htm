<div class="blockquot"><p>Don't be ashamed if you can't
blikkel any more. It's because
you couldn't help framishing.</p></div>

<div class="figleft1"><img src="images/image_s1.jpg" alt="S" width="55" height="50" /></div>
<p>hurgub," said the
tape recorder. "Just like
I told you before, Dr.
Blair, it's krandoor, so don't expect
to vrillipax, because they
just won't stand for any. They'd
sooner framish."</p>

<p>"Framish?" Jonathan heard his
own voice played back by the
recorder, tinny and slightly nasal.
"What is that, Mr. Easton?"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> know. Like when you
guttip. Carooms get awfully bevvergrit.
Why, I saw one actually&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's go back a little, shall
we?" Jonathan suggested. "What
does shurgub mean?"</p>

<p>There was a pause while the
machine hummed and the recorder
tape whirred. Jonathan
remembered the look on Easton's
face when he had asked him that.
Easton had pulled away slightly,
mouth open, eyes hurt.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, I <i>told</i> you!" he
had shouted. "Weeks ago! What's
the matter? Don't you blikkel
English?"</p>

<p>Jonathan Blair reached out
and snapped the switch on the
machine. Putting his head in his
hands, he stared down at the top
of his desk.</p>

<p>You learned Navajo in six
months, he reminded himself
fiercely.</p>

<p>You are a highly skilled
linguist. What's the matter?
Don't you blikkel English?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_h.jpg" alt="H" width="41" height="40" /></div>
<p>e groaned and started searching
through his briefcase for
the reports from Psych. Easton
must be insane. He must! Ramirez
says it's no language. Stoughton
says it's no language. And <i>I</i>,
Jonathan thought savagely, say
it's no language.</p>

<p>But&mdash;</p>

<p>Margery tiptoed into the study
with a tray.</p>

<p>"But Psych," he continued
aloud to her, "Psych says it <i>must</i>
be a language because, they say,
Easton is <i>not</i> insane!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," sighed Margery,
blinking her pale blue eyes.
"That again?" She set his coffee
on the desk in front of him. "Poor
Jonathan. Why doesn't the Institute
give up?"</p>

<p>"Because they can't." He
reached for the cup and sat glaring
at the steaming coffee.</p>

<p>"Well," said his wife, settling
into the leather chair beside him,
"<i>I</i> certainly would. My goodness,
it's been over a month now since
he came back, and you haven't
learned a thing from him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we've learned some. And
this morning, for the first time,
Easton himself began to seem
puzzled by a few of the things
he was saying. He's beginning to
use terms we can understand.
He's coming around. And if I
could only find some clue&mdash;some
sort of&mdash;"</p>

<p>Margery snorted. "It's just
plain foolish! I knew the Institute
was asking for trouble when
they sent the <i>Rhinestead</i> off. How
do they know Easton ever got
to Mars, anyway? Maybe he did
away with those other men, cruised
around, and then came back
to Earth with this made-up story
just so he could seem to be a
hero and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Why?" she demanded stubbornly.
"Why is it?"</p>

<p>"Because the <i>Rhinestead</i> was
tracked, for one thing, on both
flights, to and from Mars. Moonbase
has an indisputable record
of it. And besides, the instruments
on the ship itself show&mdash;"
He found the report he had been
searching for. "Oh, never mind."</p>

<p>"All right," she said defiantly.
"Maybe he did get to Mars.
Maybe he did away with the
crew after he got there. He knew
the ship was built so that one
man could handle it in an emergency.
Maybe he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look," said Jonathan patiently.
"He didn't do anything of the
sort. Easton has been checked so
thoroughly that it's impossible to
assume anything except, (a) he
is sane, (b) he reached Mars and
made contact with the Martians,
(c) this linguistic barrier is a result
of that contact."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_m.jpg" alt="M" width="43" height="40" /></div>
<p>argery shook her head,
sucking in her breath. "When
I think of all those fine young
men," she murmured. "Heaven
only knows what happened to
them!"</p>

<p>"You," Jonathan accused,
"have been reading that columnist&mdash;what's-his-name?
The one
that's been writing such claptrap
ever since Easton brought the
<i>Rhinestead</i> back alone."</p>

<p>"Cuddlehorn," said his wife.
"Roger Cuddlehorn, and it's not
claptrap."</p>

<p>"The other members of the
crew are all alive, all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose Easton told you
that?" she interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did."</p>

<p>"Using double-talk, of course,"
said his wife triumphantly. At
the look on Jonathan's face, she
stood up in guilty haste. "All
right, I'll go!" She blew him a
kiss from the door. "Richie and
I are having lunch at one. Okay?
Or would you rather have a tray
in here?"</p>

<p>"Tray," he said, turning back
to his desk and his coffee. "No,
on second thought, call me when
lunch is ready. I'll need a break."</p>

<p>He was barely conscious of the
closing of the door as Margery
left the room. Naturally he didn't
take her remarks seriously, but&mdash;</p>

<p>He opened the folder of pictures
and studied them again,
along with the interpretations by
Psych, Stoughton, Ramirez and
himself.</p>

<p>Easton had drawn the little
stick figures on the first day of
his return. The interpretations all
checked&mdash;and they had been
done independently, too. There
it is, thought Jonathan. Easton
lands the <i>Rhinestead</i>. He and the
others meet the Martians. They
are impressed by the Martians.
The others stay on Mars. Easton
returns to Earth, bearing a message.</p>

<p>Question: What is the message?</p>

<p>Teeth set, Jonathan put away
the pictures and went back to
the tape on the recorder. "Yes,"
said his own voice, in answer to
Easton's outburst. "I do&mdash;er&mdash;blikkel
English. But tell me, Mr.
Easton, do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Under-stand?" The man
seemed to have difficulty forming
the word. "You mean&mdash;"
Pause. "Dr. Blair, I murv you.
Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Murv," repeated Jonathan.
"All right, you murv me. Do you
murv this? I do not always murv
what you say."</p>

<p>A laugh. "Of course not. How
could you?" Suppressed groan.
"Carooms," Easton had murmured,
almost inaudibly. "Just when
I almost murv, the kwakut goes
freeble."</p>

<p>Jonathan flipped the switch on
the machine. "Murv" he wrote
on his pad of paper. He added
"Blikkel," "Carooms" and "Freeble."
He stared at the list. He
should understand, he thought.
At times it seemed as if he did
and then, in the next instant, he
was lost again, and Easton was
angry, and they had to start all
over again.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_s.jpg" alt="S" width="26" height="40" /></div>
<p>ighing, he took out more
papers, notes from previous
sessions, both with himself and
with other linguists. The difficulty
of reaching Easton was unlike
anything he had ever before
tackled. The six months of Navajo
had been rough going, but
he had done it, and done it well
enough to earn the praise of Old
Comas, his informant. Surely, he
thought, after mastering a language
like that, one in which the
student must not only learn to
imitate difficult sounds, but also
learn a whole new pattern of
thought&mdash;</p>

<p>Pattern of thought. Jonathan
sat very still, as though movement
would send the fleeting clue
back into the corner from which
his mind had glimpsed it.</p>

<p>A whole new frame of reference.
Suppose, he toyed with the
thought, suppose the Martian
language, whatever it was, was
structured along the lines of Navajo,
involving clearly defined
categories which did not exist in
English.</p>

<p>"Murv," he said aloud. "I
murv a lesson, but I blikkel a
language."</p>

<p>Eagerly, Jonathan reached
again for the switch. Categories
clearly defined, yes! But the categories
of the Martian language
were not those of the concrete or
the particular, like the Navajo.
They were of the abstract. Where
one word "understand" would do
in English, the Martian used
two&mdash;</p>

<p>Good Lord, he realized, they
might use hundreds! They
might&mdash;</p>

<p>Jonathan turned on the machine,
sat back and made notes,
letting the recorder run uninterrupted.
He made his notes, this
time, on the feelings he received
from the words Easton used.
When the first tape was done, he
put on the second.</p>

<p>Margery tapped at the door
just as the third tape was ending.
"In a minute," he called,
scribbling furiously. He turned
off the machine, put out his cigarette
and went to lunch, feeling
better than he had in weeks.</p>

<p>Richie was at the kitchen sink,
washing his hands.</p>

<p>"And next time," Margery was
saying, "you wash up before you
sit down."</p>

<p>Richie blinked and watched
Jonathan seat himself. "Daddy
didn't wash his hands," he said.</p>

<p>Margery fixed the six-year-old
with a stern eye. "Richard, don't
be rude."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image_001.jpg" width="400" height="555" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well, he didn't." Richie sat
down and reached for his glass
of milk.</p>

<p>"Daddy probably washed before
he came in," said Margery.
She took the cover off a tureen,
ladled soup into bowls and passed
sandwiches, pretending not to
see the ink-stained hand Jonathan
was hiding in his lap.</p>

<p>Jonathan, elated by the promise
of success, ate three or four
sandwiches, had two bowls of
soup and finally sat back while
Margery went to get coffee.</p>

<p>Richie slid part way off his
chair, remembered, and slid back
on again. "Kin I go?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Please may I be excused,"
corrected his father.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_r.jpg" alt="R" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>ichie repeated, received a
nod and ran out of the dinette
and through the kitchen,
grabbing a handful of cookies
on the way. The screen door
banged behind him as he raced
into the backyard.</p>

<p>"Richie!" Margery started after
him, eyes ablaze. Then she
stopped and came back to the
table with the coffee. "That boy!
How long does it take before
they get to be civilized?" Jonathan
laughed. "Oh, sure," she
went on, sitting down opposite
him. "It's funny to you. But if
you were here all day long&mdash;"
She stirred sugar into her cup.
"We should have sent him to
camp, even if it would have
wrecked the budget!"</p>

<p>"Oh? Is it that bad?"</p>

<p>Margery shuddered. "Sometimes
he's a perfect angel, and
then&mdash;It's unbelievable, the
things that child can think of!
Sometimes I'm convinced children
are another species altogether!
Why, only this morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," Jonathan broke in,
"next summer he goes to camp."
He stood up and stretched.</p>

<p>Margery said wistfully, "I suppose
you want to get back to
work."</p>

<p>"Ummmm." Jonathan leaned
over and kissed her briefly. "I've
got a new line of attack," he said,
picking up his coffee. He patted
his wife's shoulder. "If things
work out well, we might get away
on that vacation sooner than we
thought."</p>

<p>"Really?" she asked, brightening.</p>

<p>"Really." He left the table and
went back to his den.</p>

<p>Putting the next tape on the
machine, he settled down to his
job. Time passed and finally
there were no more tapes to listen
to.</p>

<p>He stacked his notes and
began making lists, checking
through the sheets of paper for
repetitions of words Easton had
used, listing the various connotations
which had occurred to Jonathan
while he had listened to
the tapes.</p>

<p>As he worked, he was struck
by the similarity of the words
he was recording to the occasional
bits of double-talk he had
heard used by comedians in theaters
and on the air, and he allowed
his mind to wander a bit,
exploring the possibilities.</p>

<p>Was Martian actually such a
close relative to English? Or had
the Martians learned English
from Easton, and had Easton
then formed a sort of pidgin-English-Martian
of his own?</p>

<p>Jonathan found it difficult to
believe in the coincidence of the
two languages being alike, unless&mdash;</p>

<p>He laughed. Unless, of course,
Earthmen were descended from
Martians, or vice versa. Oh, well,
not my problem, he thought
jauntily.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_h.jpg" alt="H" width="41" height="40" /></div>
<p>e stared at the list before
him and then he started to
swear, softly at first, then louder.
But no matter how loudly he
swore, the list remained undeniably
and obstinately the same:</p>

<p><b>Freeble&mdash;Displeasure (Tape 3)</b></p>

<p><b>Freeble&mdash;Elation (Tape 4)</b></p>

<p><b>Freeble&mdash;Grief (Tape 5)</b></p>

<p>"How," he asked the empty
room, "can a word mean grief
and elation at the same time?"</p>

<p>Jonathan sat for a few moments
in silence, thinking back
to the start of the sessions with
Easton. Ramirez and Stoughton
had both agreed with him that
Easton's speech was phonemically
identical to English. Jonathan's
trained ear remembered
the pronunciation of "Freeble"
in the three different connotations
and he forced himself to
admit it was the same on all
three tapes in question.</p>

<p>Stuck again, he thought gloomily.</p>

<p>Good-by, vacation!</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette and stared
at the ceiling. It was like saying
the word "die" meant something
happy and something sad at one
and the same, like saying&mdash;</p>

<p>Jonathan pursed his lips. Yes,
it could be. If someone were in
terrible pain, death, while a thing
of sorrow, could also mean release
from suffering and so become
a thing of joy. Or it could
mean sorrow to one person and
relief to another. In that case,
what he was dealing with here
was not only&mdash;</p>

<p>The crash of the ball, as it
sailed through the window behind
his desk, lifted Jonathan
right from his chair. Furious, his
elusive clue shattered as surely
as the pane of glass, he strode to
the window.</p>

<p>"Richie!"</p>

<p>His son, almost hidden behind
the lilac bush, did not answer.</p>

<p>"I see you!" Jonathan bellowed.
"Come here!"</p>

<p>The bush stirred slightly and
Richie peeped through the leaves.
"Did you call me, Daddy?" he
asked politely.</p>

<p>Jonathan clamped his lips shut
and pointed to the den. Richie
tried a smile as he sidled around
the bush, around his father, and
into the house.</p>

<p>"My," he marveled, looking at
the broken glass on the floor inside.
"My goodness!" He sat
down in the leather chair to
which Jonathan motioned.</p>

<p>"Richie," said his father, when
he could trust his voice again,
"how did it happen?"</p>

<p>His son's thin legs, brown and
wiry, stuck out straight from the
depths of the chair. There was a
long scratch on one calf and numerous
black-and-blue spots
around both knees.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Richie. He
blinked his eyes, deeper blue than
Margery's, and reached up one
hand to push away the mass of
blond hair tumbling over his
forehead. He was obviously trying
hard to pretend he wasn't in
the room at all.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_j.jpg" alt="J" width="22" height="40" /></div>
<p>onathan said, "Now, son,
that is not a good answer.
What were you doing when the
ball went through the window?"</p>

<p>"Watching," said Richie truthfully.</p>

<p>"How did it <i>go</i> through the
window?"</p>

<p>"Real fast."</p>

<p>Jonathan found his teeth were
clamped. No wonder he couldn't
decode Easton's speech&mdash;he
couldn't even talk with his own
son!</p>

<p>"I mean," he explained, his patience
wavering, "you threw the
ball so that it broke the window,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it to," said
Richie.</p>

<p>"All right. That's what I wanted
to know." He started on a
lecture about respect for other
people's property, while Richie
sat and looked blankly respectful.
"And so," he heard himself
conclude, "I hope we'll be more
careful in the future."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Richie.</p>

<p>A vague memory came to Jonathan
and he sat and studied
his son, remembering him when
he was younger and first starting
to talk. He recalled the time
Richie, age three, had come bustling
up to him. "Vransh!" the
child had pleaded, tugging at his
father's hand. Jonathan had gone
outside with him to see a baby
bird which had fallen from its
nest. "Vransh!" Richie had crowed,
exhibiting his find. "Vransh!"</p>

<p>"Do I get my spanking now?"
asked Richie from the chair. His
eyes were wide and watchful.</p>

<p>Jonathan tore his mind from
still another recollection: the old
joke about the man and woman
who adopted a day-old French
infant and then studied French
so they would be able to understand
their child when he began
to talk. Maybe, thought Jonathan,
it's no joke. Maybe there
<i>is</i> a language&mdash;</p>

<p>"Spanking?" he repeated absentmindedly.
He took a fresh
pencil and pad of paper. "How
would you like to help with
something, Richie?"</p>

<p>The blue eyes watched carefully.
"Before you spank me or
after?"</p>

<p>"No spanking." Jonathan
glanced at the Easton notes,
vaguely aware that Richie had
suddenly relaxed. "What I'm going
to do," he went on, "is say
some words. It'll be a kind of
game. I'll say a word and then
you say a word. You say the
first word you think after you
hear my word. Okay?" He cleared
his throat. "Okay! The first
word is&mdash;house."</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> house."</p>

<p>"Bird," said Jonathan.</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;tree." Richie scratched
his nose and stifled a yawn.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_d.jpg" alt="D" width="38" height="40" /></div>
<p>isappointed, Jonathan
reminded himself that Richie
at six could not be expected to
remember something he had said
when he was three. "Dog."</p>

<p>"Biffy." Richie sat up straight.
"Daddy, did you know Biffy had
puppies? Steve's mother showed
me. Biffy had four puppies, Daddy.
<i>Four</i>!"</p>

<p>Jonathan nodded. He supposed
Richie's next statement would be
an appeal to go next door and
negotiate for one of the pups, and
he hurried on with, "Carooms."</p>

<p>"Friends," said Richie, eyes
still shining. "Daddy, do you
suppose we could have a pup&mdash;"
He broke off at the look on Jonathan's
face. "Huh?"</p>

<p>"Friends," repeated Jonathan,
writing the word slowly and unsteadily.
"Uh&mdash;vacation."</p>

<p>"Beach," said Richie cautiously,
still looking scared.</p>

<p>Jonathan went on with more
familiar terms and Richie slowly
relaxed again in the big chair.
From somewhere in the back of
his mind, Jonathan heard Margery
say, "Sometimes I think
they're a different species altogether."
He kept his voice low
and casual, uncertain of what he
was thinking, but aware of the
fact that Richie was hiding something.
The little mantel clock
ticked drowsily, and Richie began
to look sleepy and bored as
they went through things like
"car" and "school" and "book."
Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friend," said Jonathan.</p>

<p>"Allavarg," yawned Richie.
"No!" He snapped to, alert and
wary. "I mean <i>Steve</i>."</p>

<p>His father looked up sharply.
"What's that?"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Richie.</p>

<p>"Richie," said Jonathan,
"what's a Caroom?"</p>

<p>The boy shrugged and muttered,
"<i>I</i> dunno."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do!" Jonathan
lit a cigarette. "What's an Allavarg?"
He watched the boy bite
his lips and stare out the window.
"He's a friend, isn't he?" coaxed
Jonathan. "<i>Your</i> friend? Does he
play with you?"</p>

<p>The blond head nodded slowly
and uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Where does he live?" persisted
Jonathan. "Does he come over
here and play in your yard? Does
he, Richie?"</p>

<p>The boy stared at his father,
worried and unhappy. "Sometimes,"
he whispered. "Sometimes
he does, if I call him."</p>

<p>"How do you call him?" asked
Jonathan. He was beginning to
feel foolish.</p>

<p>"Why," said Richie, "I just
say 'Here, Allavarg!' and he
comes, if he's not too busy."</p>

<p>"What keeps him busy?" Such
nonsense! Allavarg was undoubtedly
an imaginary playmate.
This whole hunch of his was utter
nonsense. He should be at
work on Easton instead of&mdash;</p>

<p>"The nursery keeps him busy,"
said Richie. "Real busy."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_j.jpg" alt="J" width="22" height="40" /></div>
<p>onathan frowned. Did
Richie mean the greenhouse
down the road? Was there a Mr.
Allavarg who worked there?
"Whose nursery?"</p>

<p>"Ours." Richie wrinkled his
face thoughtfully. "I think I better
go outside and play."</p>

<p>"<i>Our</i> nursery?" Jonathan
stared at his son. "Where is it?"</p>

<p>"I think I better go play," said
Richie more firmly, sliding off the
chair.</p>

<p>"Richard! <i>Where</i> is the nursery?"</p>

<p>The full lower lip began to
tremble. "I can't tell you!"
Richie wailed. "I promised!"</p>

<p>Jonathan slammed his fist on
the desk. "Answer me!" He knew
he shouldn't speak this way to
Richie; he knew he was frightening
the boy. But the ideas racing
through his mind drove him to
find out what this was all about.
It might be nothing, but it also
might be&mdash;"Answer me, Richard!"</p>

<p>The child stifled a sob. "Here,"
he said weakly.</p>

<p>"<i>Here</i>? Where?"</p>

<p>"In my house," said Richie.
"And Steve's house and Billy's
and all over." He rubbed his eyes,
leaving a grimy smear.</p>

<p>"All right," soothed Jonathan.
"It's all right now, son. Daddy
didn't mean to scare you. Daddy
has to learn these things, that's
all. Just like learning in school."</p>

<p>The boy shook his head resentfully.
"<i>You</i> know," he accused.
"You just forgot."</p>

<p>"What did I forget, Richie?"</p>

<p>"You forgot all about Allavarg.
He told me! It was a different
Allavarg when you were
little, but it was almost the same.
You used to play with <i>your</i> Allavarg
when you were little like
me!"</p>

<p>Jonathan took a deep breath.
"Where did Allavarg come from,
Richie?"</p>

<p>But Richie shook his head
stubbornly, lips pressed tight. "I
promised!"</p>

<p>"Richie, a promise like that
isn't a good one," pleaded Jonathan.
"Allavarg wouldn't want
you to disobey your father and
mother, would he?"</p>

<p>The child sat and stared at
him.</p>

<p>This was a very disturbing
thought and Jonathan could see
Richie did not know how to deal
with it.</p>

<p>He pressed his momentary advantage.
"Allavarg takes care of
little boys and girls, doesn't he?
He plays with them and he looks
after them, I'll bet."</p>

<p>Richie nodded uncertainly.</p>

<p>"And," continued Jonathan,
smiling what he hoped was a winning,
comradely smile at his son,
"I'll bet that Allavarg came from
some place far, far away, didn't
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Richie softly.</p>

<p>"And it's his job to be here
and look after the&mdash;the nursery?"
Jonathan bit his lip. Nursery?
Earth? Carooms&mdash;Martians? His
head began to ache. "Son, you've
got to help me understand. Do
you&mdash;do you murv me?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_r.jpg" alt="R" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>ichie shook his head. "No.
But I <i>will</i> after&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After what?"</p>

<p>"After I grow up."</p>

<p>"Why not now?" asked Jonathan.</p>

<p>The blond head sank lower.
"Because you framish, Daddy."</p>

<p>His father nodded, trying to
look wise, wincing inwardly as
he pictured his colleagues listening
in on this conversation. "Well&mdash;why
don't you help me so I
<i>don't</i> framish?"</p>

<p>"I can't." Richie glanced up,
his eyes stricken. "Some day, Allavarg
says, <i>I'm</i> going to framish,
too!"</p>

<p>"Grow up, you mean?" hazarded
Jonathan, and this time
his smile was real as he looked at
the smudged eyes and soft round
cheeks. "Why, Richie," he went
on, his voice suddenly husky,
"it's fun to be a little boy, but
there'll be lots to do when you
grow up. You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish I was Mr. Easton!"
Richie said fiercely.</p>

<p>Jonathan held his breath.
"What about Mr. Easton?"</p>

<p>Richie squirmed out of the
chair and clutched Jonathan's
arm. "Please, Daddy! If you let
Mr. Easton go back, can I go,
too? Please? Can I?"</p>

<p>Jonathan put his hands on his
son's shoulders. "Richie! What
do you know about Mr. Easton?"</p>

<p>"Please? Can I go with him?"
The shining blue eyes pleaded up
at him. "If you don't let him go
back pretty soon, he's going to
framish again! Please! Can I?"</p>

<p>"He's going to framish," nodded
Jonathan. "And what then?"
he coaxed. "What'll happen after
he framishes? Will he be able
to tell me about his trip?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> dunno," said Richie. "I dunno
how he <i>could</i>. After you framish,
you don't remember lots
of things. I don't think he's even
gonna remember he <i>went</i> on a
trip." The boy's hands shook
Jonathan's arm eagerly. "Please,
Daddy! Can I go with him?"</p>

<p>"No!" Jonathan glared and released
his hold on Richie. Didn't
he have troubles enough without
Richie suggesting&mdash;"About the
nursery," he said briskly. "Why
is there a nursery?"</p>

<p>"To take care of us." Richie
looked worried. "Why can't I
go?"</p>

<p>"Because you can't! Why don't
they have the nursery back
where Allavarg came from?"</p>

<p>"There isn't any room." The
blue eyes studied the man, looking
for a way to get permission
to go with Mr. Easton.</p>

<p>"No room? What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>Richie sighed. Obviously he'd
have to explain first and coax
later. "Well, you know my
school? You know my teacher
in school? You know when my
teacher was different?" He peered
anxiously at Jonathan, and
suddenly the man caught on.</p>

<p>"Of course! You mean when
they split the kindergarten into
two smaller groups because there
were too many&mdash;"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_h.jpg" alt="H" width="41" height="40" /></div>
<p>is voice trailed off. Too
many. Too many what? Too
many Martians on Mars? Growing
population? No way to cut
down the birth rate? He pictured
the planet with too many
people. What to do? Move out.
Take another planet. Why didn't
they just do that? He put the
question to Richie.</p>

<p>"Oh," said his son wisely, "they
couldn't because of the framish.
They <i>did</i> go other places, but
everywhere they went, they framished.
And after you framish,
you ain't&mdash;<i>aren't</i> a Caroom any
more. You're a Gunderguck and
of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and a Caroom doesn't like
to framish and be a Gunderguck,"
continued Richie happily,
as though reciting a lesson learned
in school. "He wants to be a
Caroom <i>all</i> the time because it's
better and more fun and you
know lots of things you don't remember
after you get to be a
Gunderguck. Only&mdash;" he paused
for a gulp of air&mdash;"only there
wasn't room for <i>all</i> the Carooms
back home and they couldn't find
any place where they could be
Carooms all the time, because of
the framish. So after a long time,
and after they looked all over all
around, they decided maybe it
wouldn't be so bad if they sent
some of their little boys and girls&mdash;the
ones they didn't have room
for&mdash;to some place where they
could be Carooms longer than
most other places. And <i>that</i>
place," Richie said proudly, "was
right here! 'Cause <i>here</i> there's
almost as much gladdisl as back
home and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gladdisl?" Jonathan echoed
hoarsely. "What's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and after they start growing
up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gladdisl," Jonathan repeated,
more firmly. "Richie, what is
it?"</p>

<p>The forehead puckered momentarily.
"It's something you
breathe, sort of." The boy shied
away from the difficult question,
trying to remember what
Allavarg had said about gladdisl.
"Anyway, after the little boys
and girls start to grow up and
after they framish and be Gundergucks,
like you and Mommy,
the Carooms back home send
some <i>more</i> to take their places.
And the Gundergucks who used
to be Carooms here in the nursery
look after the new little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! Wait a minute!"
Jonathan interrupted suspiciously.
"I thought you said
Allavarg looks after them."</p>

<p>"He does. But there's so many
little Carooms and there aren't
many Allavargs and so the Gundergucks
have to help. You
help," Richie assured his father.
"You and Mommy help a little
bit."</p>

<p>Big of you to admit it, old
man, thought Jonathan, suppressing
a smile. "But aren't you
<i>our</i> little boy?" he asked. He
had a sudden vision of himself
addressing the scientists at the
Institute: "And so, gentlemen,
our babies&mdash;who, incidentally,
are really Martians&mdash;<i>are</i> brought
by storks, after all. Except in
those cases where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The doctor brought me in a
little black bag," said Richie.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>

<p>he boy stood silent and studied
his father. He sort of remembered
what Allavarg had
said, too. Things like You <i>mustn't
ever tell</i> and <i>It's got to be a
secret</i> and <i>They'd only laugh at
you, Richie, and if they didn't
laugh, they might believe you
and try to go back home and
there just isn't any room.</i></p>

<p>"I think," said Richie, "I think
I better&mdash;" He took a deep
breath. "Here, Allavarg," he called
in a soft, piping voice.</p>

<p>Jonathan raised his head.
"Just what do you think you're
doing&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a sound behind him,
and Jonathan turned startledly.</p>

<p>"Shame on you," said Allavarg,
coming through the broken
window.</p>

<p>Jonathan's words dropped
away in a faint gurgle.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Richie.
"Don't be dipplefit."</p>

<p>"It's a mess," Allavarg replied.
"It's a krandoor mess!" He waved
his arm in the air over Jonathan's
head. "And don't think
I'm going to forget it!" The insistent
hiss of escaping gas hovered
over the moving pellet in
his hand. "Jivis boy!"</p>

<p>Jonathan coughed suddenly.
He got as far as "Now look here"
and then found that he could
neither speak nor move. The gas
or whatever it was stung his eyes
and burned in his throat.</p>

<p>"Why don't you just freeble
him?" Richie asked unhappily.
"You're using up all your gladdisl!
Why don't you freeble him
and get me another one?"</p>

<p>"Freeble, breeble," grumbled
Allavarg, shoving the capsule directly
under Jonathan's nose.
"Just like you youngsters, always
wanting to take the easy way
out! Gundergucks don't grow on
blansercots, you know."</p>

<p>Jonathan felt tears start in
his eyes, partly from the fumes
and partly from a growing realization
that Allavarg was sacrificing
precious air for him. He
tried to think. If this was gladdisl
and if this would keep a man
in the state of being a Caroom,
then&mdash;</p>

<p>"There," said Allavarg, looking
unhappily at the emptied
pellet. He shook it, sniffed it and
finally returned it to the container
at his side.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Richie whispered.
"But he kept askin' me and askin'
me."</p>

<p>"There, there," said Allavarg,
going to the window. "Don't fret.
I know you won't do it again."
He turned and looked thoughtfully
at Jonathan. He winked at
Richie and then he was gone.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_j.jpg" alt="J" width="22" height="40" /></div>
<p>onathan rubbed his eyes.
He could move now. He
opened his mouth and waggled
his jaws. Now that the room
was beginning to be cleared of
the gas, he realized that it had
had a pleasant odor. He realized&mdash;</p>

<p>Why, it was all so simple! Remembering
his sessions with Easton,
Jonathan laughed aloud. So
simple! The message? <i>Stay away
from Mars! No room there! They
said I could come back if I gave
you the message, but I have to
come back alone because there's
no room for more people!</i></p>

<p>No room? Nonsense! Jonathan
reached for the phone, dialled the
Institute and asked for Dr.
Stoughton. No room? On the
paradise that was Mars? Well,
they'd just have to make room!
They couldn't keep that to themselves!</p>

<p>"Hello, Fred?" He leaned back
in his chair, feeling a surge of
pride and power. Wait till they
heard about this! "Just wanted
to tell you I solved the Easton
thing. Just a simple case of hapsodon.
You see, Allavarg came
and gave me a tressimox of gladdisl
and now that I'm a Caroom
again&mdash;What? What do you
mean, what's the matter? I said
I'm not a Gunderguck any
more." He stared at the phone.
"Why, you spebberset moron!
What's the matter with you?
Don't you blikkel English?"</p>

<p>From the depths of the big
chair across the room, Richie
giggled.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
